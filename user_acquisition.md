# 📢 User Acquisition Strategy  
**Project Title:** నా గ్రామం – నా కథ (My Village, My Story)  
**Summer of AI 2025 | viswam.ai – Corpus Collection Engine**

---

## 🎯 Objective

This document outlines the user acquisition strategy for *My Village, My Story*, an open-source, AI-powered storytelling platform built to collect real voices, memories, and stories from Telugu-speaking rural communities. The core goal is to gather linguistically rich and culturally rooted data for training **open-source Telugu Large Language Models (LLMs)** — all through voluntary, self-initiated community participation.

This strategy prioritizes **scalability, inclusivity, and zero-barrier access** by eliminating the need for field volunteers or in-person data collection.

## 👥 Target Users

Our app is designed for grassroots participation by people in rural India, especially in Telugu-speaking regions. Primary contributors include:

- 🧓 Village elders sharing folk stories, oral history, and life experiences  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Families and women passing on traditions or cultural insights  
- 🎓 Students and teachers from rural schools documenting their surroundings  
- 📱 Youth and creators with smartphones interested in preserving heritage  

This broad approach ensures data diversity across gender, dialect, and age groups.

## 🛠️ App Distribution Strategy

### 1. **Open Web Access**
- The application will be hosted publicly on platforms like **Hugging Face Spaces**, ensuring easy access without any installations.
- Users can access it via mobile or desktop with a simple internet connection.
- **No sign-up or login required** — removing all entry barriers.

### 2. **Organic Discovery via Digital Channels**
We aim to use **low-cost, high-reach digital distribution** strategies such as:

- WhatsApp broadcast messages in rural community groups  
- Short, friendly explainer videos in Telugu showing how to use the app  
- Posters and voice messages shared via local NGOs, schools, and youth volunteers  
- Telegram groups and community Facebook pages targeting rural areas

### 3. **Multilingual & Inclusive UX**
- The interface is built to support **Telugu-first usage**, with options for Hindi and English.
- Contributors can:
  - **Type stories** using Telugu script or other supported languages  
  - **Record and upload voice stories** in their mother tongue  
- Easy instructions, visual cues, and minimal text are used for low-literacy accessibility.

## 🌱 Community-Based Adoption (No Field Volunteers Required)

Unlike traditional survey methods, our model encourages **self-driven participation**:

- Families help elders record stories at home  
- Teachers in rural schools may introduce the tool as part of language or history activities  
- Youth can be community anchors by sharing the link and demoing the tool in local gatherings  
- NGO partners and college student ambassadors will be used only for digital outreach, not for manual collection

## 📶 Support for Low Bandwidth Environments

The app is optimized for rural conditions:

- Lightweight frontend with fast loading  
- Audio file sizes are compressed while retaining quality  
- Minimal dependency on continuous internet — basic uploading is sufficient  
- Future versions may offer **offline caching** and later syncing

---

## 📢 Growth Through Local Pride and Ownership

This app positions contributors as **cultural custodians** rather than survey respondents. Strategies include:

- Highlighting top stories (anonymously) in posters, radio-style snippets, or school exhibitions  
- Encouraging each village to contribute at least 5–10 stories as a "digital footprint"  
- Future community features like regional leaderboards, badges, or community shout-outs (if desired)

---

## 🔍 Feedback Loop and Iteration

We plan to gather optional feedback from contributors via:

- Optional forms for educators or digital youth groups  
- WhatsApp helpline for app usability questions (in Phase 2)  
- Observing most-used language, region-based participation, and submission type (text/audio)  

---

## 🔐 Privacy and Consent

- No personal data (name, phone number, email) is collected  
- Every story is submitted anonymously and is treated as **public domain**  
- App clearly states that all submissions will be used for **training open-source AI models**

---

## 🧠 AI Alignment & Ethical Usage

This strategy ensures that:

- Telugu AI models are **built from community-authenticated, real-world stories**  
- The process of AI creation is **inclusive, transparent, and participatory**  
- Contributors indirectly shape the language tools of the future
